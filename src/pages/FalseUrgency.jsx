      Confirmshaming
      </h2>

      <p className="hidden text-gray-500 md:mt-4 md:block">

      Confirmshaming is a persuasive technique employed in web design and marketing, often criticized for its manipulative nature. This strategy involves using guilt or shame to coerce users into taking a desired action, typically by making them feel guilty for not subscribing, opting in, or making a purchase. By employing negative language or guilt-tripping statements, businesses aim to push users into compliance. However, this approach is controversial, as it can be perceived as unethical and may lead to a negative perception of the brand. Critics argue that building trust and providing genuine value is a more sustainable and ethical way to engage users, rather than resorting to confirmshaming tactics.

      Scarcity
      </h2>

      <p className="hidden text-gray-500 md:mt-4 md:block">
      The Scarcity Pattern induces (truthfully or falsely) the impression that goods or services are only available in limited numbers.

This example exerts pressure by displaying the number of teapots available. The use of colors draws attention to this information and intensifies this effect. The pattern suggests: Buy quickly, otherwise the beautiful product will be gone!

Scarcity Patterns are also used in versions where the alleged scarcity is simply invented or where it is not made clear whether the limited availability relates to the product as a whole or only to the contingent of the portal visited.

      Countdowns
      </h2>

      <p className="hidden text-gray-500 md:mt-4 md:block">
      Countdown patterns induce (truthfully or falsely) the impression that a product or service is only available for a certain period of time. This is illustrated through a running clock or a lapsing bar. You can watch as the desired good slips away.

In the example, (according to the tweet author) the timer automatically resets itself as soon as it has expired. The only purpose of the timer is to put buyers under pressure and to induce them to buy.
